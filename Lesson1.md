# Lesson 1 - Git and GitHub

Version control tools are commonly used to track changes in a code base and allow developers to collaborate. Git is one such tool which we will use extensively.

As a brief introduction to Git, please read [A Beginnerâ€™s Git and GitHub Tutorial](http://blog.udacity.com/2015/06/a-beginners-git-github-tutorial.html).

## Practical exercise
Create a git repository. Add a file called README.md to the repository and write some information in it using [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). Sync your repository to your GitHub profile. Make sure to join the [apprenticeship program organization](https://github.com/jdsutton-apprentice).
