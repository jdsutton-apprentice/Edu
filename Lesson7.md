# Unit Testing
Unit testing is the process of testing parts of a program.

1. [Read about unit testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing)
2. [Learn how to unit test in Python](http://www.drdobbs.com/testing/unit-testing-with-python/240165163)

## Practical exercise
Write a Python function with returns `True` if its input is a prime number and `False` otherwise. Thoroughly unit test this function. As always, commit your code to GitHub.
