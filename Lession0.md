# Lesson 0 - Linux and the Unix terminal
Linux is a free, open-source operating system like Windows or MacOS. Many developers use Linux becaue of its programming-friendly environment. You can install Linux alongside your OS without losing any data, or run it inside a [virtual machine](https://www.virtualbox.org/).

For newcomers to Linux I recommend [Linux Mint](https://www.linuxmint.com/) because it is very Windows-like in appearance.

## Practical exercise
Install a linux distribution of your choice. Learn to use the [Linux shell](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_learning_the_shell.php).
